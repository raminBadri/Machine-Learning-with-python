# Machine-Learning-with-python

### This is where I will upload all my machine-learning samples and practices.

* You will find all the necessary files in the repository's *main branch*.
* All *data files* are included so feel free to do your own practice.
* Note that all files are done via *Jupyter Notebook* in *Python 3.12*

All samples are done via:

* Python ver 3.12
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib


All you need is to install them before using by:
```python
{
pip install <package-name>
}
```
Later in code import them using:
```python
{
import <package-name>
OR
from <package-name> import <module-name>
}
```
